The Stealify Framework to build Web Driven Gui and Serverless Applications. WDA Framework

This is Stealify as Electron drop in replacement like Flavor it gets used to Incremental adopt JustJS, Graaljs, Deno, Nodejs, NWJS and Electron Open Source Projects.

We try to create a good Documentation for it so that you can easy Adopt this Concepts when you come from a existing Community like NextJS, React, DoneJS, Electron, VSCode, Theia, .....

Stealify it self is more then just a framework it is a whole concept to build Secure Scaleable Software it also implements best pratices enforced by Software Architectural Principels so by Design it makes you a better Programmer. It is a ambitious Project inititated because of a need for it as it is to error prune to create cross platform device applications today People (Programmer) do get into the mindset that they do not even need to understand the stacks they use anymore as they are to complicated this is a dangerouse state in Software Development and we identifyed Solutions for that. Stealify is a attempt to Tackle world wide existing Technical Dept on the root level. Stealify Framework helps you and us to Incremental adopt Software into our Secure Ecosystem that is again Maintainable and Solves existing Issues in the Linux *nix Community and all its dependencies from the Kernel till userland Application.

The Tools that compose this framework can be used all indipendently as Stealify is designed from the ground up to run anywhere and always in a modular component driven fashion. A Component as stealify defined term is always a Function Composition when this term gets used in web context eg: webcomponent then it refences a collection of webelements or webelement handling functions. This clear Concepts and Definitions will allow you to code faster with less inconsistencys and friction. Everything is a Component and on the Lowest Level a Component can Consist out of a Single Function. 

As you see we did also invest into teach ablity of our concepts as this is one of the main drivers to create this framework we have the goal and ambitions to make you a better coder via consistent wording and documentation a cross the Open Source Community. But we have a big effort to do before we reach our goal as of time of writing not a single project is in shape there do exist some components that are in shape but they are not published
in a good useable way as we could not agree on publishing standards till today. We need to make that more consistent but again all this is not Easy it is Senior Development work that needs the biggest Brains and Oldest Engineers on Earth to get done right.

## Getting Started

Btw This is also Theia and Open VSX Compatible so you can use the best of all Worlds as Stealify Advisory is at its Core the Stealify Event Stream System SESS you can connect even vscode or code-server deployments with each other to create distributed IDE Expirences.


## After Started?!
git clone any existing Electron Project and Stealify Advisory should guide you directly.
